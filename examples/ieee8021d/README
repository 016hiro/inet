IEEE 802.1d examples
====================

These examples show the STP/RSTP capability of the ethernet switch.

STP/RSTP is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for any
bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP/RSTP
is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.
The protocol make any topology to a tree topology.
The time needed to the STP make the topology loop-free is nearly 50s, while the RSTP only needs 6s.

In the example, we find a network with multiple loops in it.
After the STP/RSTP done its job, we can see the loopless topology's links and the root switch highlighted with a light blue color.

Switch1RootByMAC
----------------
The example shows without any configuration how Switch1 chosen to be the root, because it has the lowest MAC address.
Also you can check how the shortest path will be chosen. Switch2 will route his traffic through Switch4 instead of Switch7,
because it has shorter path to the root.

Switch3RootByPriority
---------------------
Now Switch3 will be the root because it has the lowest priority number.


Switch7to4BySrcPriority
-----------------------
Switch7 will route his traffic through Switch4 instead of Switch3. They have the same long path, but Switch4 has better priority.


LargeNet
--------
This example shows, how traffic runs through the network.
Also Switch4 disappears at 60s and reappears at 120s, so you can check how the tree will rebuild itself.
