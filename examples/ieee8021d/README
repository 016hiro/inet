IEEE 802.1d examples
====================

Exaple shows the STP/RSTP capability of the ethernet switch


Switch1RootByMAC
----------------
The example shows whitout any configuration how Switch1 choosen to be the root, because it has the lowest MAC address
Also you can check how the sortest path will be choosen. Switch2 will route his traffic through Switch4 insted of Switch7,
because it has sorther path to the root.

Switch3RootByPriority
---------------------
Now Switch3 will be the root because it has the lowest priority number.


Switch7to4BySrcPriority
-----------------------
Switch7 will route his traffic through Switch4 insted of Switch3. They have the same long path, but Switch4 has better priority .


LargeNet
--------
This example shows, how traffic run though the network.
Also Switch4 disappears at 60s and reappears at 90s, so you can chech how the tree will rebuild itself.
