INET 4.0 TODOs
==============

The new INET 4.0 release contains changes related to three main topics:
 
 - Network Node Architecture
 - Packet Tags
 - Flat Packet
 
Additionally, all other changes that are backward incompatible but easy to do
should be included in INET 4.0.

 - port *all* protocols to the new packet API (e.g. 802.11)
 - eliminate all KLUDGES introduces by the 3 main infrastructure changes
 - eliminate all control infos attached to packets
 + removing ethernet padding should be done in upper protocols if length is not present

 - extract LLC from ethernet and 802.11
 - ethernet socket vs. ssap/dsap both in StandardHost and EtherHost
 - revise and merge signals, add details parameter (e.g. packetDropped)
 - revise physical layer error models wrt. how errors are represented

 - revise all network node module base class hierarchy (e.g. mpls nodes)
 - implement all necessary message compiler changes to avoid clutter in msg files
 - revise protocol base class hierarchy (e.g. LayeredProtocolBase vs IPv4 base class, etc.)
 - revise protocol header class hierarchy (e.g. avoid unnecessary interfaces)
 - simplify INetfilter interface by removing parameters other than the datagram
 - use InterfaceEntry class instead of cCompoundModule for the corresponding network interface (merge the two)
 - move extra functions that doesn't really belong to L3AddressResolver (e.g. findInterfaceTableOf, findIPv4RoutingTableOf)
 - replace cCompoundModule class in hosts/nodes with a specific classes such as StandardHost
   providing getInterfaceTable, getMobility, getIPv4NetworkLayer, etc. to avoid random code fragments with getSubmodule(".ipv4.routingTable")???
   but we should avoid having these classes for a random collections of utility functions!
 - add separate classes/functions for iterating over the network nodes in a network or
   finding a network node based on its mac address/ip address or finding the position of a network node, etc.
 - add missing interface NED files for all L2 protocols
 - remove obsolete dataTransferMode and the like
 - rewrite serializers that use structure bit fields, this is undefined behavior

 - update all NED and C++ documentation
 - rename all upper case abbreviations to camel case (e.g. TCPConnection -> TcpConnection)
 - rename IdealRadio to UnitDiskRadio, IdealMac to MaMac?
 - nicely position submodules in compound modules, prepare for 2 info lines
 - extend main protocol modules (and all submodules) with 2 info lines above the submodule icon
 - avoid specifying module icon sizes by default, override icon size in submodules
 - sort includes alphabetically
 - pretty print white spaces

 - review all examples and check if they still do what is intended
