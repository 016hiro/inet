LSP preemption example.

The network consists of 5 LSRs and 4 hosts. The LSP between host1
and host3 is established before host1 starts sending packets.
As host1 starts sending packets, new LSP setup competes resouce with
the old LSP (host1-host3). Since the new LSP's setup priority is higher 
than the old LSP's holding priority, the old LSP is preempted by the new one.
