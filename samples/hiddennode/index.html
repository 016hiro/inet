	<center><h1>Hidden Node Example</h1></center>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>

	<p>
		This example demonstrates the hidden node problem in 802.11 wireless networks,
		and the RTS/CTS mechanism that solves it.
	</p>

	<p><b>Description of the hidden node problem</b></p>

		<p>
		The hidden node problem occurs in a wireless network when two transmitting nodes are
		out of range of each other, and cannot detect when the other is transmitting. They both
		transmit to an intermediate node that is in transmission range of both of them. Since
		they don't know when the other is transmitting, normal collision detection and avoidance
		is not effective, and often their transmissions will interfere at the intermediate node.
		(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem" target="blank">Hidden node problem</a> on wikipedia).
	</p>

<p>
		The solution that is empoyed in 802.11 networks are the Request to send/Clear to send frames (RTS/CTS).
		Before transmitting a frame, hosts send an RTS frame addressed to the target node. The target node then replies
		with a CTS frame. The transmitting node sends and ACK, and transmits
		the frame that it originally wanted to transmit.
</p>

<p>
		Nearby hidden nodes can only receive the CTS, but not the RTS, which indicates to them
		that there is another node out of range, about to transmit. It defers from transmitting, until
		the ongoing transmission is over. It knows the exact time from the duration field of the CTS frame. The CTS, RTS and ACK frames each have a duration field, which indicate how much time is left until the
		entire packet exchange (RTS,CTS,ACK,payload frame,ACK) is completed. This way, any node that receives one of the frames
		knows when the channel will become available for transmission.
</p>

<p><b>Demonstrating the hidden node problem</b></p>

<p>
	The simulation contains 3 models. The first one doesn't use the RTS/CTS mechanism, so effectively the hidden node problem is
	not addressed here. The second one adds the RTS/CTS mechanism, which addresses the problem, adding some overhead to the
	transmissions in the process. The third one is for reference, showing what would happen if there was no hidden node in the first place.
</p>

<p><h2>The model</h2></p>

	<p>
		The network in the simulation contains 3 hosts, arranged in a triangle.
		Host A and C are separated by a wall which blocks transmissions, and thus the nodes cannot transmit to each other.
		They are both sending UDP packets to Host B, which can receive the transmissions
		of both.
