	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>
		This example examines the scalability of simulations. The metric of scalability will be the running time of
		the simulation. There will be a number of simulation runs, which will contain an increasing number of hosts.
		The running time will be plotted in the function of the number of hosts contained.
