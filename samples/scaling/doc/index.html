	<h1><center>Scaling Example</center></h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>

	<p>
		This example examines how simulations scale up as the number of
		simulated wireless hosts is increased. The metric of scalability will be the running time of
		the simulation. There will be a number of simulation runs running until the same sim-time-limit, and each will contain an increasing number of hosts.
		The running time will be plotted as the function of the number of hosts contained.
	</p>

	<h2>The model</h2>

	<p><b>The network</b></p>

	<p>The network contains a variable number of <tt>WirelessHost</tt>s. The exact number is specified by the <i>numHosts</i> variable, and will be
		increased in subsequent simulation runs. The hosts are randomly placed on the playground.
	</p>

	<p><b>Scenarios</b></p>

	<p>Host[0] will act as the target for traffic generated by the other hosts. There will be different configurations using different radio models and different
		traffic models that can be compared, according
		to running time. The two radio models will be <tt>IdealRadio</tt> and <tt>APSKScalarRadio</tt>. The two traffic models will be ping requests
		and UDP packets.
	</p>

	<p>
		For each case there will be multiple simulation runs, with increasing number of hosts. The simulation runs will use these logarithmically increasing <i>numHosts</i> values: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, with each simulation running for 0.1s simulated time. The running time of each run will be recorded in scalar result files, so
		they can be analyzed.
	</p>

	<p>
		<tt>IdealRadio</tt> is simpler than <tt>APSKScalarRadio</tt>, and it is expected that it will scale better. Occasional short ping requests are expected
		to scale better than UDP traffic that fills the channel, as it has more computing requirements.
	</p>

	<p><b>Configurations</b></p>

	<p>There are 4 configurations for 4 dististinct cases:

		<li>Hosts send ping requests to host[0]. The radio model is <tt>IdealRadio</tt>, with interference turned off.</li>
		<li>Hosts send ping requests to host[0]. The radio model is <tt>APSKScalarRadio</tt>, with CSMA-CA turned on to avoid collisions.</li>
		<li>Hosts send UDP packets to host[0]. The radio model is <tt>IdealRadio</tt>, with interference turned off.</li>
		<li>Hosts send UDP packets to host[0]. The radio model is <tt>APSKScalarRadio</tt>, with CSMA-CA turned on.</li>

	<p>Optional: how to do batch run</p>
