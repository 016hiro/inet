<h1><center>Visualizing Submodule Information</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
Various compound modules in INET contain submodules that display information about their state in the graphical runtime environment.
This is of limited use, since one has to enter the compound modules to see this information. Information of important
submodules can be visualized at containing network nodes, at the top level of the network. This makes such information conveniently
available at glance, without the need to open graphical views or going into compound modules.
This example contains a configuration that demonstrates visualization of nodes' IEEE 802.11 channel access state.
</p>

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
The <var>InfoVisualizer</var> module can visualize information of a submodules for a network node on the top level canvas.
The submodules can be selected with the visualizer's <var>modules</var> parameter. This parameter takes full path module names.
Wildcards can be used to select a certain submodule name in multiple nodes. Additionally, one can specify multiple submodule names.

<p>TODO: about the content parameter, and how its visualized.</p>

<h2>The visualization</h2>

<p>
The network for the simulation is the following:
</p>

<img src="infonetwork.png">

<p>
It contains 3 <var>AdhocHosts</var> arranged in a simple chain. It also contains an <var>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</var>,
an <var>Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium</var>, and an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> module. The communicaton ranges of hosts
is determined by their radio transmitter power, which is configured so that hosts can only reach adjacent hosts.
Hosts' routing tables are set up accordingly, <var>source</var> is configured to send UDP packets to <var>destination</var> via
<var>relay</var>.
</p>

<p>
The visualizer is configured to visualize node's channel access state. This is contained in each node's Contention module.
The location of the Contention module is <var>AdhocHost/wlan/mac</var>:

<div class="snippet">
*.visualizer.*.infoVisualizer.modules = "*.*.wlan[0].mac.ctn[0]"
</div>

<pre>
TODO: you can specify multiple modules... "modules = *.*.wlan[0].mac.ctn[0] *.*.interfaceTable"

this might be an important feature...a note and a screenshot might be enough ?
