the ieee80211 visualizer thing

there should be a simple

where there is an accesspoint

and a wirelesshost

and it connects and associates with it

the more complex should be like the one in the example

yeah

basically yeah

can a wireless host have 2 wireless cards and be associated to two different APs?
simultaneously ?



and what is it about?

its good because of convenience

you dont have to drill down in the inspectors to find out the association state

its presented at a glance

very convenient

the bubble tell you that it got associated but not if they are still, or associated to what

it also can tell the signal strenght

which you can find out from the logs

so basically it tells the association state, what ap it is associated with (ssid) and the signal strength
