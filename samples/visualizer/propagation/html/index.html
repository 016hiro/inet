<h1>Propagation Visualization Example</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<pre>
the problem is there are multiple hosts transmitting simulateously in a large network
this visualization makes it easier to see which nodes are transmitting and which are receiving at a time
what transmissions are present at various nodes at a time
misc features are the communication ranges and interference ranges. This helps in the placement of nodes, and to fine tune the transmitter
power settings. -> this is not about propagation, its about the mediumvisualizer, so its misc
</pre>

<p>
In a large network, there might be multiple wireless nodes transmitting simulataneously, causing interference at receiving nodes.
One has to go through the logs to see which transmissions are received by which nodes.
One has to go through the tedious process of scanning the logs to see which transmissions are received by which nodes.
The visualization makes it easier to see which nodes are transmitting and which are receiving at any given time,
and what transmissions are present at various nodes.
</p>

<p>
This example contains 3 configurations of increasing complexity, each showing different features of the visualization.
