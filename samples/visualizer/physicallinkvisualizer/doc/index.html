	<h1><center>Physical Link Visualization Example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
    <p> 
        In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other over a physical link.
        The physical connection between nodes are established using either cable or wireless media.
        In wireless networks we don't see, whether it is possible to communicate through the radio medium.
        This link displayed by the <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>.
        Without this visualization we need to examine the console to find out whether the physical link is established between the nodes.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of 2 simulation models, each demonstrating different features of physical link visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the Visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        When a packet is received by a node flawlessly, a physical link is established between the transmitter and the receiver nodes.
        The <code><strong>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</strong></code> keeps track of active physical links in a network.
        A link becomes active between two nodes when a packet arrives at the receiver node's physical link layer from the source node's physical link layer.
        By default links are not displayed, we can enable their visualization by switching the <i>displayLinks</i> parameter to true.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The links are represented visually by dotted arrows.
        The arrow's starting point is the sender node and its endpoint is the receiver node.
        The visualizer has filtering parameters, like <i>nodeFilter</i>, <i>interfaceFilter</i> and <i>packetFilter</i>.
        Using these we can specify which physical links are shown. By default all nodes, all interfaces and all packets are considered for displaying physical links.
        It is possible to use logical expressions as the filter's parameter, e.g <i>packetFilter = "ping* or tcp*"</i> shows the ping and the tcp physical links.
    </p>     


	<p><h2>Enabling Visualization of Physical Links</h2></p>
    <p>
        This configuration demonstrates how to enable the visualization of physical links.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use this simple network for this configuration:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screen" src="PhysicalLinkVisualizerSimple.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        The network contains 2 <var>Adhochosts</var>. The network also has a <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>, an <var>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</var> and an <var>Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium</var> module.<br>
        The <var>source</var> pings the <var>destination</var>.
        This line of code enables the visualization:
        <div class="snippet">
            *.linkVisualizer.*.displayLinks = true
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following animation depicts what happens, when we start the simulation:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=544 height=318 src="EnablingPhysicalLinks.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        When one node receives any packet flawlessly from the other node, a physical link is activated between the nodes.
        It's represented by an arrow, that starts from the transmitter node and points to the receiver node.
    </p>

	<p><h2>Displaying Dynamic Physical Links</h2></p>
    <p>
        The goal of this configuration is displaying dynamically changing active physical links in a wireless environment.
        The physical links show, which nodes are able to communicate with each other directly.
        Here is the network for this configuration:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screen" src="PhysicalLinkVisualizerDynamic.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        The network contains an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var>, an <var>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</var> and an <var>Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium</var> module.
        The topology consists of 7 <var>AODVRouters</var>, they move randomly between predefined borders.
        The nodes have two UDP applications: an <var>UDPBasicApp</var> and an <var>UDPSink</var>.
        The broadcast messages are sent by the <var>UDPBasicApp</var> and they are received by the <var>UDPSink</var>.
        We set the packets' name to <i>Broadcast</i>.
        We visualize only these messages.
        <div class="snippet">
            *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.displayLinks = true<br>
            *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.packetFilter = "*Broadcast*"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.fadeOutMode = "simulationTime"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.fadeOutTime = 1.3s<br>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is what happens, when we run the simulation:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=512 height=669 src="PhysicalLinkDynamic.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        RESULT<br>
        A Broadcast csomagok hatasara sok pontozott nyil jelenik meg a node-ok kozott.
        A nyil afele mutat, aki tudta fogadni a packetet fizikai retegben.
        Ahogy a node-ok mozognak a linkek eltunnek, ujak alakulnak.
