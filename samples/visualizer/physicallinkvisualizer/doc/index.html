	<h1><center>Physical link visualizer example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
    <p> 
        In wireless networks we can't identify physical connections between the nodes, because we don't see radio signals. It is important to determine which nodes received the sent packet and whether the destination host or hosts received the packet through the wireless channel. 
        Visualizing physical links we can determine the first layer links in the network.
        We can identify at a glance which nodes received a packet from another node.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of 3 simulation models, each demonstrating different features of physical link visualization.

    <p><h2>About the visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <code><strong>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</strong></code> keeps track of active physical links in a network.
        A link becomes active between two nodes when a packet arrives at the receiver node's physical link layer from the source node's physical link layer.
        By default links are not displayed, we can enable their visualization by switching the <i>displayLinks</i> parameter to true.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The links are represented visually by dotted arrows.
        The arrow's starting point is the sender node and its endpoint is the receiver node.
        The visualizer has filtering parameters, like <i>nodeFilter</i>, <i>interfaceFilter</i> and <i>packetFilter</i>.
        Using these we can specify which physical links are shown. By default all nodes, all interfaces and all packets are considered for displaying physical links.
        It is possible to use logical expressions as the filter's parameter, e.g <i>packetFilter = "ping* or tcp*"</i> shows the ping and the tcp physical links.
