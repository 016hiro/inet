	<h1><center>Physical link visualizer example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
    <p> 
        In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other over a physical link.
        The physical connection between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media.
        In wireless networks we don't see, whether it is possible to communicate through the radio medium.
        When a packet is received by a node flawless, a physical link is established between the sender and the receiver nodes.
        This link displayed by the <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>.
        Without this visualization we need to examine the console to find out whether the physical link is established between the nodes.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of 3 simulation models, each demonstrating different features of physical link visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <code><strong>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</strong></code> keeps track of active physical links in a network.
        A link becomes active between two nodes when a packet arrives at the receiver node's physical link layer from the source node's physical link layer.
        By default links are not displayed, we can enable their visualization by switching the <i>displayLinks</i> parameter to true.
    </p>
    <p> 
        The links are represented visually by dotted arrows.
        The arrow's starting point is the sender node and its endpoint is the receiver node.
        The visualizer has filtering parameters, like <i>nodeFilter</i>, <i>interfaceFilter</i> and <i>packetFilter</i>.
        Using these we can specify which physical links are shown. By default all nodes, all interfaces and all packets are considered for displaying physical links.
        It is possible to use logical expressions as the filter's parameter, e.g <i>packetFilter = "ping* or tcp*"</i> shows the ping and the tcp physical links.
    </p>     


	<p><h2>Enabling physical links</h2></p>
    <p>
        This configuration demonstrates how to enable the visualization of physical links.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use this simple network for this configuration:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="screen" src="PhysicalLinkVisualizerSimple.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        The network contains 2 <var>Adhochosts</var>. The network also has a <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>, an <var>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</var> and an <var>Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium</var> module.<br>
        The <var>source</var> has one ping application, its destination is the <var>destination</var>.<br>
        An additional line of code enables the visualization:
        <div class="snippet">
            *.linkVisualizer.*.displayLinks = true
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following animation depicts what happens, when we start the simulation:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=544 height=318 src="EnablingPhysicalLinks.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        When one node receives any packet from the other node, a physical link is activated between the nodes.
        It's represented by an arrow, that starts from the transmitter node and points to the receiver node.
