<h1><center>Transport Connection Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<pre>
why is it good?

because you can see active transport connections...maybe you could see that from the inspector window
if you dig deep...there might be a list of active tcp connections or something

TODO: if you click on the visualization, the inspector window comes up. Write this to the routing table visualization sample too.

So...you can see active tcp connections, and where are they...their endpoints.

The visualizer doesnt care what routes packets take

thats what the transport route visualizer is for

So this is a useful information.

You dont have to dig deep or something. But can you even do that ? Yes you can

So

why is it good?

because you can see the connections. You can see the number of connections, and their endpoints.
All at once, at glance. You can get an overview of everything.

You dont have to look around in the inspectors...which is not as straightforward

Its just...easy to understand better. Nope. Routing tables are harder to understand, requires more effort.
Cos there is numberic data. But. Here is numeric data as well. Not as hard. But tedious.
So. Use the visualizer, and you dont have to do that.

Thats why its good.

And what is it ? It can help you identify the endpoints of different TCP connections just by looking at the network.
Active connections. And tell them apart. And know how many of them are there.

<p>
Transport connection visualization makes it easy to get information about the established transport connections in the network at glance.
It provides an overview of the number of connections. Also, it gives information about the two end-hosts of a connection. It can help
identify and tell apart different connections.

<p>
Transport connection visualization makes it easy to get information about the active transport connections in the network at a glance, without
using the inspector window.
It makes it easy to identify connections by their two end-hosts, and to tell different connections apart. It also gives a quick overview about
the number of connections in in certain nodes and the whole network. This example demonstrates such visualization of TCP connections.

<p>
The example consist of 2 simulation models. The first one demonstrates the basic use of the visualization. The second, more complex configuration
showcases a more advanced use-case.

The visualizer for this purpose is the <code><strong>TransportConnectionVisualizer</strong></code>. TODO: how it works
