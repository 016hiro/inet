<h1><center>Transport Connection Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
Transport connection visualization makes it easy to get information about the active transport connections in the network at a glance, without drilling down in the GUI.
It makes it easy to identify connections by their two end-hosts, and to tell different connections apart. It also gives a quick overview about
the number of connections in certain nodes and the whole network. This example demonstrates such visualization of TCP connections.
</p>

<p>
The example consist of 2 simulation models. The first one demonstrates the basic use of the visualization. The second, more complex configuration
showcases a more advanced use-case. TODO: The second, more complex configuration shows the more advanced features.
</p>

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
The <code><strong>TransportConnectionVisualizer</strong></code> displays an icon above the two end-hosts of an active, established transport layer level connection. It reacts to changes
in the state of the connection. It places the icon when the connection is established, and removes it when it is closed. The icons are color coded, denoting different connections. Should there be more connections than available colors,
a number in the icon helps differentiate between connections with the same icon color. Naturally, there can be multiple connections
open at a node, thus there can be multiple icons.
</p>

<p>
The <code><strong>nodeFilter</strong></code> parameter specifies which hosts' connections should be visualized.
The <code><strong>portFilter</strong></code> parameter selects connections to be visualized based on their port numbers.
By default, connections with all port numbers in all hosts are visualized.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that packet paths belonging to the connection have no effect on this visualization (see Visualizing Transport Routes TODO).
The transport connection visualization doesn't indicate anything about what paths packets take.
</p>

<h2>1. Enabling the visualization of transport connections</h2>

This configuration uses the following simple network:

<img src="simplenetwork.png">

<p>
It consist of 2 <code><strong>StandardHosts</strong></code> connected to each other. It also contains a <code><strong>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</strong></code> and a <code><strong>TransportConnectionVisualizer</strong></code> module.
</p>

<p>
TCP applications are set up in both hosts, and <code><strong>host1</strong></code> is configured to connect to <code><strong>host2</strong></code>, and send TCP packets to it.
The visualization of transport connections is enabled with the visualizer's <code><strong>displayTransportConnections</strong></code> parameter:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
*.visualizer.*.transportConnectionVisualizer.displayTransportConnections = true
</div>

<p>TODO: include this in the routingtable sample</p>

<p>
When the simulation is run for a while and TCP connection is established, the network looks like this:
</p>

<p>
The icon representing the end-points of the TCP connection is placed above the hosts.
</p>

<h2>Advanced features of the visualization</h2>

<p>
This configuration demonstrates the visualization of multiple connections. It uses the following network:
</p>

<img src="complexnetwork.png">

<p>
There are two <code><strong>StandardHosts</strong></code> connected to a switch, which is connected via a router
to another <code><strong>StandardHost</strong></code>, the server. The hosts are configured to connect to the
server via TCP and send packets to it.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple TCP applications set up in the hosts that connect to the server:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code><strong>host1</strong></code>: 2 connections on port 80 (http), 1 connection on port 22 (ssh)</li>
<li><code><strong>host2</strong></code>: 1 connection on port 80, 1 connection on port 22</li>
</ul>

<p>The visualizer is instructed to only visualize connections on port 80:</p>

<div class="snippet">
*.visualizer.*.transportConnectionVisualizer.portFilter = "80"
</div>

<p>
When the simulation is run and the connections are established, the network looks like the following:
</p>

<img src="port80.png">

<pre>
So now host2 has 2 port80 connections and host1 has 1

1. figure: only the port 80 connectons are visualized. 2 for host1 and 1 for host2 and 3 for the server. portfilter = 80
2. figure: screenshot only...set portfilter to 22. 1 connection for each host, 2 for the server.
3. figure: screenshot only...also set nodefilter to host2. 1 connection.
4. figure: screenshot only...display all connections. 3 for host1, 2 for host2, and 5 for the server.

will have to explain that there can be multiple connections. And that they are color coded.
and that you can use node and port filters.

here is an idea: have a big network, maybe as a third config, or just a screenshot. big network, lots of connections,
and lots of routes -> this visualizer is not concerned with routes.
