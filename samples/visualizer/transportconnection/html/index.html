<h1><center>Transport Connection Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
Transport connection visualization makes it easy to get information about the active transport connections in the network at a glance, without
using the inspector window.
It makes it easy to identify connections by their two end-hosts, and to tell different connections apart. It also gives a quick overview about
the number of connections in certain nodes and the whole network.
The example consist of 2 simulation models. The first one demonstrates the basic use of the visualization. The second, more complex configuration
showcases a more advanced use-case.
</p>

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
The visualizer for this purpose is the <code><strong>TransportConnectionVisualizer</strong></code>.
It displays an icon above the two end-hosts of an active, established transport layer level connection. It reacts to changes
in the state of the connection. It places the icon when the connection is established, and removes it when it is no longer in the
established state. The icons are color coded, denoting different connections. Should there be more connections than available colors,
a number in the icon helps differentiate different connections with the same colored icon. Naturally, there can be multiple connections
open at a node, thus multiple icons.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that packet paths belonging to the connection have no effect on this visualization (see Visualizing Transport Routes TODO).
The transport connection visualization doesn't indicate anything about what paths packets take.

<h2>1. Enabling the visualization of transport connections</h2>

This configuration uses the following simple network:

<p>
It consist of 2 <code><strong>StandardHosts</strong></code> connected by a 100Mbit/s ethernet cable. It also contains a <code><strong>IPv4NetworkConfigurator</strong></code> and a <code><strong>TransportConnectionVisualizer</strong></code> module.
