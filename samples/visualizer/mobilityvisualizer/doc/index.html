	<h1><center>Mobility visualizer example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals - WIP</h2></p>
	<p>
		When nodes roam in a network, it's often difficult to follow their movement.
        
        By visualizing the nodes' movement, we get information about their recent movements, velocities and orientations.


        By visualizing trajectory, velocity and orientation, we get enough information about the nodes' movement.
        TODO: Maybe 1-2 more sentences
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of 1 simulation model, that demonstrates some features of mobility visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> displays data about movements of the wireless nodes.
        The visualizer has three main parameters: Movement trail, velocity and orientation.
        Movement trail shows the node's recent movement trajectory. We can set its length using the <i>trailLength</i> parameter.
        Velocity is represented visually by a solid arrow. Its length is proportional to the speed, but we can modify this ratio with a velocity scaling factor called <i>velocityArrowScale</i>.
        Orientation represented by an arc. Its size can be modified.
    </p>


	<p><h2>Displaying mobility</h2></p>
    <p>
        This example demonstrates, how the customized parameters change the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        We place two <var>Adhochosts</var> on the playground.
        Because of the mobility settings, they move randomly between the predefined borders.
        There is one difference between the nodes. The host1 speed is 15mps, the host2 speed is 30mps.
    </p>
    <p>
        The visualization of mobility is enabled, because the <i>displayMovements</i> parameter is true by default.
        It is really confusing, if we run the simulation now:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=616 src="ShowNothing.mp4">
    </p>

    <p>
        We display the movement trail, the velocity vector and the orientation arc of the node.
        Here is the configuration:
        <div class="snippet">
            # Visualizer parameters<br>
            # Movement trail<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayMovementTrails = true<br>
            <br>
            # Velocity vector<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
            <br>
            # Orientation<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayOrientations = true<br>
        </div>
        Now it is easy to follow the nodes' movement:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=616 src="DefaultParams.mp4">
    </p>

    <p>
        It could happen that, we want to customize the visualization e.g. we want to highlight any parameter.
        Now we specifiy the parameters of velocity arrow:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=616 src="CustomParams.mp4">
    </p>
