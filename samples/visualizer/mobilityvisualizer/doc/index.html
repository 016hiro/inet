	<h1><center>Mobility Visualization Example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
	<p>
		When wireless nodes roam in the network, it's often difficult to follow their movement.        
        By displaying nodes' movement trajectory, velocity and orientation, we can see enough information to track them.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of one simulation model, that demonstrates important features of mobility visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the Visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> displays data about the movements of wireless nodes.
        The visualization is enabled by the <i>displayMovements</i> parameter, which is true by default.
    </p>
    <p>
        The visualizer has three main features: Movement trail, velocity vector and orientation.
        By default, these features are turned off.
        Each of these features has a parameter, which enables its visualization by setting it to true.
        These parameters are the <i>displayMovementTrails</i>, the <i>displayVelocities</i> and the <i>displayOrientations</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Movement trail shows the node's recent movement trajectory.
        We can set its length using the <i>trailLength</i> parameter.
        When the trail's length is longer than the <i>trailLength's</i> value, the end of the line starts to fade out.
        The trail's color is different for each node, because of the <i>movementTrailLineColor = "auto"</i> parameter.
        This option makes the nodes' traceability easier.
    </p>
    <p>
        Velocity is represented visually by a solid arrow.
        Its length is proportional to the speed.
        By modifying the <i>velocityArrowScale</i> parameter we multiply the arrow's size.
        The arrow's direction coincides with the movement's direction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Orientation is represented by an arc. The arc's size is specified by the <i>orientationArcSize</i> parameter.
        This value is the relative size of the arc compared to a full circle.
        Its default value is 0.25, i.e. a quarter or a circle.
    </p>
<!--    <p>
        The visualizer has a <i>moduleFilter</i> parameter which determines which mobilities are considered at the visualization.
        It matches all mobilities by default.
    </p>-->


	<p><h2>Displaying Mobility</h2></p>
    <p>
        This example demonstrates, how the customized parameters change the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        We place two <var>Adhochosts</var> on the playground.
        Because of the mobility settings, they move randomly between the predefined borders.
        There is one difference between the nodes. The <var>host1's</var> speed is 15 mps, <var>host2's</var> speed is 30 mps.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we start the simulation with the visualization's default settings, we can see nodes which move randomly on the playground.
        It is really confusing we can't trace their movement:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="ShowNothing.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        We display the movement trail, the velocity vector and the orientation arc of the node.
        Here is the configuration:
        <div class="snippet">
            # Movement trail<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayMovementTrails = true<br>
            <br>
            # Velocity vector<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
            <br>
            # Orientation<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayOrientations = true<br>
        </div>
        Now it is easy to follow the nodes' movement:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="DefaultParams.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        Each node has a movement trail, a velocity vector and an orientation arc.
        The trails line colors are different, because the trail's line color is <i>"auto"</i>.
        The <var>host2's</var> velocity vector is longer, because its speed is twice than the <var>host1's</var> speed.
        The orientation arcs are turned to the movement's direction in every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it's useful to highlight a certain feature of the visualization. For example, we highlight
        the velocity arrow by customizing its appearance parameters:
        <div class="snippet">
            # Velocity vector<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityArrowScale = 2<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineColor = "blue"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineStyle = "solid"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineWidth = 2<br>
        </div>
    </p>   
    <p>
        Here is the result of these settings:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="CustomParams.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        The arrow turned blue because of the <i>velocityLineColor</i> is set to <i>blue</i> and the arrow has become two times longer and it has became twice as wide than the default velocity vector.
    </p>
