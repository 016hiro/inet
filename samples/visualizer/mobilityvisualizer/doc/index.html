	<p><h2>Goals - WIP</h2></p>
	<p>
		When wireless nodes roam in the network, it's often difficult to follow their movement.        
        By displaying nodes' movement trajectory, velocity and orientation, we can see enough information to track them.
        <!--TODO: There must be something I can write. But what...-->
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of one simulation model, that demonstrates important features of mobility visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> displays data about the movements of wireless nodes.
        The visualizer has three main parameters: Movement trail, velocity and orientation.
        Movement trail shows the node's recent movement trajectory. We can set its length using the <i>trailLength</i> parameter.
        Velocity is represented visually by a solid arrow. Its length is proportional to the speed, but we can modify this ratio with a velocity scaling factor called <i>velocityArrowScale</i>.
        Orientation is represented by an arc. The arc's size is specified by the <var>orientationArcSize</var> parameter.
        This value is the relative size of the arc compared to a full circle.
        Its default value is 0.25, i.e. a quarter or a circle.
    </p>


	<p><h2>Displaying mobility</h2></p>
    <p>
        This example demonstrates, how the customized parameters change the visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        We place two <var>Adhochosts</var> on the playground.
        Because of the mobility settings, they move randomly between the predefined borders.
        There is one difference between the nodes. The <var>host1's</var> speed is 15 mps, <var>host2's</var> speed is 30 mps.
    </p>
    <p>
        The visualization of mobility is enabled, because the <i>displayMovements</i> parameter is true by default.
        It is really confusing, if we run the simulation now:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="ShowNothing.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        We display the movement trail, the velocity vector and the orientation arc of the node.
        Here is the configuration:
        <div class="snippet">
            # Movement trail<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayMovementTrails = true<br>
            <br>
            # Velocity vector<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
            <br>
            # Orientation<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayOrientations = true<br>
        </div>
        Now it is easy to follow the nodes' movement:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="DefaultParams.mp4">
    </p>

    <p>
        Sometimes it's useful to highlight a certain feature of the visualization. For example, we highlight
        the velocity arrow by customizing its appearance parameters:
        </p>

        <div class="snippet">
            # Velocity vector<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityArrowScale = 2<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineColor = "blue"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineStyle = "solid"<br>
            *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.velocityLineWidth = 2<br>
        </div>
    
    <p>
        Here is the result of these settings:
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=621 src="CustomParams.mp4">
    </p>
