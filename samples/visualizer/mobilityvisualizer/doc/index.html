	<h1><center>Mobility visualizer example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
	<p>
		When nodes roam in a network, it's often difficult to follow their movement.
        Using <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> is really helpful, because we can track their movement with this visualizer.
        Another problem is we don't know the orientation of the directional antennas.
        
    </p>
    <p>    
        The example consists of 1 simulation model, that demonstrates some features of mobility visualization.
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        The <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> displays data about movements of the wireless nodes.
        The visualizer has three main parameters: Movement trail, velocity and orientation.
        Movement trail shows the node's recent movement trajectory. We can set its length using the <i>trailLength</i> parameter.
        Velocity is represented visually by a solid arrow. Its length is proportional to the speed, but we can modify this ratio with a velocity scaling factor called <i>velocityArrowScale</i>.
        Orientation represented by an arc. Its size can be modified.
    </p>

        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=616 src="ShowNothing.mp4">

    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=736 height=616 src="DefaultParams.mp4">
