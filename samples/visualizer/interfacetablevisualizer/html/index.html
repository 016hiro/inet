<h1>Visualizing Interface Information Example</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
In a large network topology with many nodes, routing can be quite complex. To see if routing tables and network addresses are configured as intended
(or to even start making sense of routing tables), one needs to know the addresses of the interfaces of various network nodes. This information
can be accessed by diving deep in the inspector panel and checking interface tables individually, which is tedious.
Visualizing interface tables makes understanding easier by indicating the interface names and addresses belonging to individual nodes,
on the top level canvas. It helps to make sense of inherently hard to grasp numeric data, by giving an overview of interfaces and addresses
in the network.
</p>

<p>
This example contains two configurations. The first one demonstrates the visualization with the visualizer's default settings,
the second one is about the advanced features.

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
The <var>InterfaceTableVisualizer</var> visualizes hosts' interfaces contained in their interface tables.
By default, the interface name and address is indicated. Wired interfaces are visualized at the corresponding gates,
wireless interfaces are displayed above the node icon. The visualization is enabled with the
<var>displayInterfaceTables</var> parameter. By default, all interfaces of all nodes are visualized.
The set of visualized interfaces can be narrowed with the configurator's <var>nodeFilter</var> and <var>interfaceFilter</var>
parameters. The <var>format</var> parameter specifies what information is displayed about interfaces.
It takes a format string, which can contain the following directives:
</p>

<ul style="font-family: monospace;">
<li>%N: interface name</li>
<li>%4 or %6: IPv4 or IPv6 address, respectively</li>
<li>%n: network address. This is either the IPv4 or the IPv6 address</li>
<li>%m: MAC address</li>
<li>%\: conditional newline for wired interfaces. The '\' needs to be escaped with another '\', i.e. '%\\'</li>
<li>%i and %s: the info() and str() functions for the interfaceEntry class, respectively</li>
</ul>

<p>
The default format string is <code>"%N %\\%n"</code>.
