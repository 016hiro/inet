<h1><center>Routing Table Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<pre>
why is this good?
because you can see the routes just by looking at the playground, without having to look at the routing table entries.
its for convenience
information about routes is presented in a compact but complete way - actually a concise way
an overview of routes and routing tables in the network at a glance
information is not as precise as from the routing tables. but. its easier to overview it.

what is this?
routing tables i mean routes are visualized as arrows.

</pre>

<p>
The RoutingTableVisualizer module module can be used to visualize routing table entries on the playground.
The RoutingTableVisualizer module can be used to visualize how packets are routed in the network.
This can be useful because a lot of information about routes is presented at a glance, without the need to examine routing tables.
This example demonstrates the use of the RoutingTableVisualizer module.

This can be useful because a lot of information about routes is presented at a glance, in a concise way. One doesn't need to examine routing tables.

<p>The example consists of 3 simulation models of increasing complexity, each demonstrating different features of <tt>RoutingTableVisualizer</tt>.</p>

<h2>1. Displaying routes</h2>
<pre>
This configuration is the simplest, and demonstrates how to enable route visualization.

It looks like the following:

<!img>

It has 2 nodes

visualization is enabled with the displayRoutes parameter = true

its the default settings
