<h1><center>Routing Table Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<pre>
why is this good?
because you can see the routes just by looking at the playground, without having to look at the routing table entries.
its for convenience
information about routes is presented in a compact but complete way - actually a concise way
an overview of routes and routing tables in the network at a glance
information is not as precise as from the routing tables. but. its easier to overview it.

what is this?
routing tables i mean routes are visualized as arrows.

an overview of routes at a glance.

</pre>

<p>
The RoutingTableVisualizer module can be used to visualize how packets are routed in the network.
This can be useful because a lot of information about routes is presented at a glance in a concise way, without the need to examine routing tables.
This example demonstrates the use of the RoutingTableVisualizer module.
</p>

<p>The example consists of 3 simulation models of increasing complexity, each demonstrating different features of <tt>RoutingTableVisualizer</tt>.</p>

<h2>About the RoutingTableVisualizer</h2>

<p>
The <tt>RoutingTableVisualizer</tt> module visualizes routing table entries in the following way. Routing table entries are represented visually by solid arrows.
An arrow going from a source node represents a routing table entry in the source node's routing table. The endpoint node of the arrow is the nexthop in
the visualized routing table entry.
</p>

<p>
The visualizer has a <i>destinationFilter</i> parameter, which specifies the destination node of the visualization.
The rule that best matches this destination in each node's routing table is visualized by the arrows.
By default, all routes are visualized towards all destinations.
The <i>nodeFilter</i> parameter controls which nodes' routing tables should be visualized.
</p>

<p>
It reacts to changes in the routing tables, for example when...
</p>

<h2>1. 'Displaying routes' configuration</h2>

<p>This configuration demonstrates how to enable the visualization of routes, and how the visualization looks like.
<p>
The network for this configuration contains 2 <tt>StandardHosts</tt>, an <tt>IPv4Configurator</tt> module and a <tt>RoutingTableVisualizer</tt> module.
The configuration contains one entry, which enables the visualization of routing tables with the <i>displayRoutingTables</i> parameter.
All other parameters of the visualizer is left at default.
</p>

<p>When the simulation is run, the network looks like the following:</p>

<p>
In this simple network, there are just two routes (HostA -> HostB, and HostB -> HostA).
Note that there are separate arrows for the two directions. However, the two arrows can be merged by setting the <i>lineShift</i> parameter to 0.
This would yield a two-directional arrow. TODO: do we need this?
