<h1><center>Obstacle Loss Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
When radio transmissions go through objects in the physical environment, the objects might reflect and absorb the electromagnetic energy,
depending on the obstacle loss model. This visualization makes it easy to see where radio waves and obstacles intersect, and to have
information about the thickness of the intersection, which is proportional to the power loss. Additinally, the loss is indicated in
numeric form, in dB's.
