<h1><center>Obstacle Loss Visualization Example</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
When radio transmissions go through objects in the physical environment, the objects might reflect and absorb the electromagnetic energy,
depending on the obstacle loss model. This visualization makes it easy to see where radio waves and obstacles intersect, and to have some
information about power loss, which is proportional to the length of the intersection. Additinally, the loss is indicated at the intersection in
numeric form, in dB's.
