	<h1><center>Power Consumption Example</center></h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>

	<p>
		This example demonstrates consumption, storage and generation of power in mobile wireless nodes.
		The hosts will send out ping requests, which will deplete their power storage, while their power generators will charge them.
	</p>

	<p><h2>The model</h2></p>

	<p><b>The network</b></p>

	<p>
		The simulation contains mobile hosts (type <tt>adhochost</tt>), the number of which can be specified in <i>omnetpp.ini</i>.
		The default number specified is 20. They are randomly placed on the playground, and don't move around.
	</p>

	<p><b>Configuration and behavior</b></p>

	<p>
		The hosts 1 through 20 are set to periodically send out ping requests to host 0. The radio transmissions will deplete the hosts' energy storage.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each host has a nominal energy storage capacity of 0.05 Joules. The charge they contain at the beginning of the simulation is randomly selected between
		0 and the nominal capacity. Hosts shut down when their energy storage reaches 0, and restart when their energy storage charges to half of the nominal capacity,
		that is 0.025 Joules.
	</p>

	<p>
		The hosts contain an <tt>AlternatingEnergyGenerator</tt>. This alternates between generation and sleep modes. It starts in generation mode, and generates the amount of power
		that is specified by its <i>powerGeneration</i> parameter (now set to 1 mW). Sleep mode, it generates no power. It stays in each mode for the duration specified by the
		<i>generationInterval</i> and <i>sleepInterval</i> parameters. These are set to a random value with a mean of 10s.
	</p>

	<p>
		Host 0 will act as the target for the ping target for all the other hosts.<!remove>
