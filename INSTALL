INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

The INET Framework can be compiled on any platform supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation, version 4.0 or later.
It must be compiled with dynamic NED loading enabled (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes
setting).

LINUX (UNIX)

1. Make sure you OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (to test, try the command "which nedtool").

2. Change to the INET directory.

3. Type "make" to build the inet executable (debug version). Use "make MODE=release" 
   to build release version.

That should be it.

Finally, try running the demo simulations. Change into examples/ and type
"./rundemo".

Note:
-----
If you add/remove files/directories later in the src directory, they will 
be added automatically to the makefile.
