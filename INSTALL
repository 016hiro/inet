INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

IPSuite can be compiled on all platforms that are supported by OMNeT++.

PREREQUISITES

You should have a working OMNeT++ installation. The latest 3.0 alpha
version (3.0 alpha 3) required, compiled with dynamic NED loading
enabled (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes setting).

LINUX (UNIX)

1. Make sure you OMNeT++ installation works OK (e.g. try running the samples)
   and it is in the path (try "which nedtool").

2. Change to the IPSuite directory and edit the ipsuiteconfig file
   to make sure it contains the right settings. You'll probably
   need to adjust ROOT and possibly also LIBXML_INCLUDES.

3. Re-generate the omnetppconfig file to get the local OMNeT++ configuration
   by typing "opp_makemake --genconfig omnetppconfig"

4. Type "make" to build everything. That should be it.

Finally, you can try running the demo simulations. cd to either
Examples/IPSuite or Examples/MPLS, and type "./rundemo".

As of now, this is still work in progress and not everything will work.
Notably, most MPLS examples will fail with TCP runtime error, and crash
on exit. We're working on the solution.

If you change something (add/remove files or directories), you'll need to
recreate the makefiles by typing "./makemake".


WINDOWS

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW, see instructions for Unix.

If you're using Microsoft Visual C++ (6.0 or .NET):

1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation. Note that 3.0 alpha versions
   are only distributed in source code form, so you'll have to compile
   it yourself. Make sure the sample simulations work OK. Also, OMNeT++
   and MSVC should be in the PATH (you can verify this by typing "nedtool"
   and "nmake" at the cmd prompt.)

2. Change to the IPSuite directory. Edit the ipsuiteconfig.vc file and
   adjust the variables in it: ROOT, OMNETPP_ROOT, ICONV_DIR, LIBXML_DIR.

3. Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" to build everything.

Finally, you can try running the demo simulations. cd to either
Examples/IPSuite or Examples/MPLS, and type "rundemo.bat".

As of now, this is still work in progress and not everything will work.
Notably, most MPLS examples will fail with TCP runtime error, and crash
on exit. We're working on the solution.

If you change something (add/remove files or directories), you'll need to
recreate the makefiles typing "./makemake".

If you change something (add/remove files or directories), you'll need to
recreate the makefiles by running "makemake.cmd" and then
"nmake -f makefile.vc depend".

Hint: creating an "m.bat" file with the content "nmake -f makefile.vc %*"
may save you quite some typing...


Have fun.
