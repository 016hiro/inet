NOTE: Network/RSVP_TE/RSVPPacket.h, line33: change cObject to cPolymorphic


- nincs IPAddress::getPrefix() and getSuffix() (like IPv6Address has)


- apps: add startTime param; IPAddressResolver should only be invoked at startTime not in initialize()!

- TCP tests fail now (TCPDump has changed)

- if a node pings itself, that'll be "destination unreachable" -- fix it

- Eth: restore original conn color when transmission ends

- "headerLength" param in snrEval???

- IPv4 configurator: should fill in next hop addresses too, not only interface (esp with Ethernet)

- rename TCPBasicClientApp to TCPRequestReplyClientApp ?

- IPv4: make it usable with ad-hoc models

- notifboard: switch to the context of the client before calling its receiveNotification()

- doxy: turn on generation if "called/referenced from" things2

AFTER omnetpp-3.2 RELEASE:
- add handleParameterChange() to apps (needed for Scenario Manager!)
- setLength(), length() --> byteLength()
- makemakefiles: -P option
- use cDisplayString setTagArg(long)
- use new opp_msgc features? (kind=..., length=...etc)
- remove Util/stlwatch.h/cc, Utils/watch2.h
