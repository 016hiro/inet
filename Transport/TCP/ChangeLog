	* TCPMain renamed to TCP

	* TCPMain.cc, TCPConnectionBase.cc: TCP got confused when it received 
	several active/passive opens with same local port number. Now it raises
	an error (~EADDRINUSE)

	* TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed bug which caused closing of a
	connection to be reported 2MSL (240s) later to the user. Basically,
	the user has to be notified already when the connection enters the
	TIME_WAIT state. (TCP stays in TIME_WAIT for 240s or longer, and 
	nothing can happen during that time that's of interest to the user.)
