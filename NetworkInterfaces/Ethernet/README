Communication between modules:

higher layer (HL) --> LLC
   dummy-cMessage with kind()=ETHCTRL_REGISTER_DSAP and contextPointer() pointing to an EtherCtrl
   dummy-cMessage with kind()=ETHCTRL_DEREGISTER_DSAP and contextPointer() pointing to an EtherCtrl
   cMessage-to-be-sent with kind()=ETHCTRL_DATA and contextPointer() pointing to an EtherCtrl

HL <-- LLC
   decapsulated cMessage with kind()=ETHCTRL_DATA

LLC --> MAC
