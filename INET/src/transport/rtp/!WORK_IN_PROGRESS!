Andras Varga, 2008 Jun:
	Found suspicious things in the code, to be checked: 
	 - packet length bit/byte mismatch?
	 - simtime_t plain cast to integer and assigned to packet fields (1s resolution)

	Also: current code is a lot more complicated than it needs to be, with lots of 
	repetition. Hints to simplify:
	 - replace cArray with std::vector everywhere
	 - use msg files (a short msg file can replace tons of source code)
	 - RTPProfile and Server/Receiver probably don't need to be modules. It's quite
	   enough if they are just classes that implement some C++ interface
	Patches welcome...

	Also: move RTPHost out under nodes/?
