	* created this package, by moving files from contract/

	* InterfaceEntry: setter methods made virtual. This has near zero
	performance cost (calls to setters are rare, and the class already
	has a vptr due to cObject). Also added backpointer to containing
	InterfaceTable.

	* InterfaceTable: implemented NotificationBoard-based notifications 
	about interface changes: NF_INTERFACE_CREATED, NF_INTERFACE_DELETED, 
	NF_INTERFACE_STATE_CHANGED, NF_INTERFACE_CONFIG_CHANGED. 
	The detail object for all four are the InterfaceEntry.

	TODO: changes to protocol-specific interface data (IPv4, IPv6)
	doesn't trigger a notification yet
