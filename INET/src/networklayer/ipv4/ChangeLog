	* RoutingTable: properly fire notifications on routing table changes

2008-07-01  Andras Varga

	* wrapped naked data members of IPv4Route into getters/setters

	* RoutingTable: enforce by returning "const" pointers that routes 
	already added cannot be changed any more (one must delete and 
	re-add it)

	* IP: factored out a createIPDatagram method

	* IP.cc: obey new "outputPort" field of IPControlInfo when sending
	multicast datagram

	* RoutingTableParser.cc: 5th field of a route in routing files is
	the metric (so far it was "preferences" but in fact it was unused)

	* IP.cc: don't forward "link-local" multicast addresses (224.0.0.x)

	* RoutingTable: localDeliver() ignores interface netmask [reported by
	Michael Tuexen]
	
	* RoutingTable: interface netmask functionality is now achieved by 
	routes of type IFACENETMASK added to the routing table. These routes
	are re-build whenever notification is received that there was a change
	in the interface IPv4 configurations.
