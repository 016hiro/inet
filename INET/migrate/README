The tools in this directory are for migrating simulation models based
on previous INET versions, written for OMNeT++ 3.x. These tools
should be run *after* the correspoding migration scripts in OMNeT++
(omnetpp-4.x/migrate/*).

How do the migration:
=====================

Prerequisites:
 - Make sure you have a *backup* of the original source files you
   want to port. Needless to say, right?
 - Also, have a good visual diff tool at hand that can also compare
   whole directory trees (k3diff, meld, winmerge, etc).

Then:
 1. unpack the sources

 2. run the scripts in omnetpp-4.x/migrate

 3. run these scripts

 4. diff the results to your original sources, and review each change.
    Migration scripts work by plain text substitution (basically global
    find/replace), and sometimes they replace things they were not
    supposed to.

 5. check the README and WhatsNew files for other INET changes that
    affect your code as well

 6. try to compile and run the simulations, fixing remaining issues
