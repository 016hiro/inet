INET Framework for OMNeT++
==========================

The OMNeT++ INET Framework contains numerous internet protocols. Beyond IP
there is TCP, UDP, Ethernet, PPP. MPLS, LDP and RSVP-TE models have also
been contributed. See the CREDITS file for the names of people involved
in the development.


Directory structure
-------------------
Directories are arranged roughly along the OSI layers.

Bottom-up:

 NetworkInterfaces/    L2 (data link layer) protocols
   _802/               common IEEE 802 stuff
   Ethernet/           Ethernet model
   PPP                 new PPP implementation
   ARP/                ARP protocol

 Network/              L3 (network layer) protocols
   IPv4/               IPv4 and associated protocols
   IPv4d/              modularized IPv4 implementation
   AutoRouting/        autoconfiguration of static routes
   MPLS/               MPLS implementation
   LDP/                LDP signalling protocol for MPLS
   RSVP_TE/            RSVP-TE signalling protocol for MPLS

 Transport/            transport layer protocols
