The OMNeT++ Internet Protocol Suite contains numerous internet
protocols. Beyond IP there is TCP, UDP and support for QoS.
MPLS, LDP and RSVP-TE models have also been contributed.
See the CREDITS file for the names of people involved in the
development. 

Compilation instructions for Unix:
----------------------------------

  1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation, version 2.3 or newer.

  2. Change to the IPSuite directory. Edit the ipsuiteconfig file
     and adjust the ROOT variable in it as well as OMNETPP_INCL_DIR
     and OMNETPP_LIB_DIR.

     
  3. Type "make" to build everything.

  4. Finally, you can have a look at the example networks by launching a
     simple demo front end:

     $ ./ipsuite-demo
           or 
     $ ./mpls-demo

Should you ever need to re-build the makefiles (only if you add/remove
files or directories), use the following command:

   $ ./makemake 


Compilation instructions for Windows:
-------------------------------------

If you're using Cygwin or MinGW, see instructions for Unix.
 
If you're using Microsoft Visual C++:

  1. You need a working OMNeT++ installation, version 2.3 or newer.

  2. Change to the IPSuite directory. Edit the ipsuiteconfig.vc file
     and adjust the ROOT and OMNETPP_ROOT variables in it.  
     
  3. Type "nmake -f Makefile.vc" to build everything.

  4. Finally, you can have a look at the example networks by launching a
     simple demo front end:

     wish84 ipsuite-demo
           or 
     wish84 mpls-demo

Where wish84 is the wish shell from the Tcl/Tk distribution. You may
have to specify its directory too, if it's not in the PATH. 

Should you ever need to re-build the makefiles (only if you add/remove
files or directories), use the following command:

   makemake.cmd 

Have fun.
