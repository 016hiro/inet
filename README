The OMNeT++ Internet Protocol Suite contains numerous internet
protocols. Beyond IP there is TCP, UDP and support for QoS.

Compilation instructions for Unix:
----------------------------------

1. you need a recent working OMNeT++ installation that must be newer
   than 2.1. This means you need to get a OMNeT++ snapshot version
   from here (follow step 2. or 3. from the Download&Build Instructions):
   http://cvs-int.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de/omnetpp/model-doc/omnetpp.html

   Sorry for this inconvenience but we had to make the IP-Suite const
   save. Only recent OMNeT++ development versions support this as will
   upcoming stable releases.
   

2. If you have a recent working OMNeT++ installation newer than 2.1,
   you need to build all Makefiles in the ip-suite sub directories:

   $ make Makefiles

   This may take a while because OMNeT++ already starts compiling some
   subdirectories in this stage.

3. Build all examples:

   $ make all

4. Finally, you can have a look at the example networks by launching a
   simple demo front end:

   $ rundemo

Compilation instructions for Windows:

Since I'm not using Windows, this is left as an exercise for the
interested user :-)
