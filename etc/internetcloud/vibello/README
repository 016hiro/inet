Vibello
Copyright (C) 2010,2011 Philipp Berndt <philipp.berndt@tu-berlin.de>

Vibello uses the Vivaldi algorithm[2] to produce a measured_data.xml file from
latency measurements. The result can be used with gnplib or PeerfactSim.KOM.

In contrast to the measured_data.xml provided with PeerfactSim.KOM,
the measured_data.xml produced by vibello also contains per host maximum bandwidths
and wire access delay that occurrs regardless of the distance of any host. This corresponds
to the "height" value described in [3].

The measurement data can be obtained from Ookla.

The scripts in the bin directory load measurement data into an SQL database
and prepare it for further processing by the vibello binary.
Vibello uses pthreads to parallize the computation. Use "--threads=" to set the number of threads.
Unless "--nox" is specified, a window shows the current GNP space every thousand iterations.
Another Script loads the vibello results back into the database before the results are written into the final measured_data.xml file.
Therein hosts are grouped by pingER continental region, country code and MaxMind Geo IP region.

Luckily for you the whole process is automated and takes only three steps:

1. Procure input files
cp PeerFact.SIM/measured_data.xml data/lookup.xml # Only <PingErLookup> and <CountryLookup> are used.

2. Configure
$ ./configure SPEEDTEST_SOURCE= PINGER_LOOKUP_SOURCE=data/lookup.xml COUNTRY_LOOKUP_SOURCE=data/lookup.xml GNP_DIMENSIONS=2

(Actually the last three arguments are the defaults and may be omitted.)

  SPEEDTEST_SOURCE
              Path to Ookla data file in CSV format
  PINGER_LOOKUP_SOURCE
              Path to XML file with PingER jitter data (data/lookup.xml)
  COUNTRY_LOOKUP_SOURCE
              Path to XML file with country lookup data (data/lookup.xml)
  GNP_DIMENSIONS
              Dimensionality of GNP space (2)

3. Make
$ make
[ You will be asked for your mysql root password to create a new database. ]

The iterative computation will take several hours, depending on the input data size and power of your machine.
Once the graph has stabilized the computation terminates.
Intermediate results will be saved every thousand iterations. So once you are satisfied with the accuracy you may stop the process anytime.
