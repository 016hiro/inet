        * [r35] *: * fixed computation of wire_access_latencies
          * fixed output of bandwidths in write_xml
          * made db column client_ip_id UNSIGNED
          * renamed db table access_delays to access_latencies
          * renamed function compute_wire_access_delays to
            compute_wire_access_latencies
          * improved output of database scripts
          * added constant MAX_LATENCY (Drop outliers where latency exceeds this
            value (milliseconds))
          * added constant MIN_CONNECTIVITY (Minimum number of connections
            required for each client.)
          * added script to convert a downloaded speedtest.csv file (from
            www.speedtest.net) to GeoIP enhanced st_net.csv format (used by Ookla)
          * added example datafile

        * [r23] bin/*: * factored out database config loading
          * added debug output to make database scripts more fun
          * remove orphaned records when preparing vibello input
            and when writing xml
