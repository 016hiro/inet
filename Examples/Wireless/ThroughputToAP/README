This example measures the IEEE 802.11 wireless network throughput from a number of hosts to the access point (AP).
The theoretical maximum throughput can be calculated using the attached Excel sheet.
The host and the access point transmitter powers are configured so that every host hears all the others.

1. One host throughput

The sheet also shows the measured throughput at the sink of the access point and 
compares it to the theoretical maximum which is roughly 5.12 Mbps. The result is that
the measured throughput and the theoretical maximum are very close actually the difference
is less than 1 kbps.

2. Multi host throughput

In this case the average backoff interval on the channel decreases but there is a
chance of frame collision. This makes the calculation of the theoretical maximum
rather complicated. To simplify things the sheet does not consider collisions when
calculating the maximum throughput. For 3 hosts the minimum backoff period is
(n - 1) ^ 2 / (4 * n) where n is the contention window size that is 32. This shows roughly
7.5 average contention window and an increased total channel throughput.

The difference between the theoretical throughput maximum and the measured throughput
is caused by collisions. Adding the number of frame collisions to the number of correctly
received frames makes the difference less than 50 kbps. This is probably caused by waiting
EIFS time instead of DIFS time after detecting a collision.
