Topology based on OSPF Networking Laboratory from Virtual Network User Mode 
Linux (VNUML) project.

Although the topology presented should be identical to that from VNUML website
(as of version 1.7), VNUML itself wasn't used for the simulation run. Also
since I wasn't able to simulate the topology as a whole on my machine, all
non-router nodes were removed from the topology to save some resources during
the UML-based simulation run.
