This is a sample to demonstrate label stacking used for creating tunnel
hierarchy.

IMPORANT: In this scenario, the Label Information Base (LIB) of all routers is
configured explicitly (LSR*_lib.xml) when the simulation starts. To my best
knowledge, the RSVP-TE itself does not support creation of tunnel hierarchy
(correct me if I'm wrong: vojta at pohoda dot cz).
