An example of Hop-by-Hop and Explicit Routing in RSVP-TE.

The network consists of 5 LSRs and 4 hosts. Host1 establishes path simply 
based on IP routing option. Host2 establishes its path based on the input 
of ROUTE specified by the administrator from an input file called traffic.xml

The format of input ROUTE is
<route>firstAddress, LBit, secondAddress, LBit, ...</route>

LBit is 1 if the nexhop is loose hop and 0 if strict.
