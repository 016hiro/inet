An example of traffic rerouting

This is to demonstrate the cability of resilience with RSVP-TE when traffic 
request is changed. In the network, there is a link is updated and its 
status is reported back to the IR. This router detects a better path for 
an existing TE tunnel and reroute the traffic to this new path.

The technique used to reroute the traffic is "make-before-break". A new 
PATH message is formed in the same session, except a new LSP_ID, and 
sent to the destination in SF style. The destination uses SF method
to reserve the resource without couting resource on the shared links twice.
