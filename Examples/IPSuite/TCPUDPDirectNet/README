This network consists of four hosts which use the UDP and TCP protocol
to communicate with each other. The example shows the ability to
handle different transport protocols simultaneously and for the IP
layer to forward data packets to the correspondent transport layers
correctly.

The IP class StandardHost is chosen for the IP node type. A simple
traffic generator is used for the UDP communication whereas the TCP
communication is driven by a custom client application.

Each of the four hosts has three network devices which are connected
to the other hosts. IP addresses are of the type "10.0.0.x" where x
denotes the host's number (this is due to a limitation in the TCP
model).
