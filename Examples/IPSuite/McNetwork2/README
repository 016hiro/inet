This is a rather complex example consisting of four router and six
hosts. It shows the routing behavior with pre configured static routes
for unicast and multicast datagrams. Multicast datagrams are
duplicated by the router only if there is a group member in the
subnet. Therefore, there is no generation of redundant or unnecessary
data packets

The hosts are simple UDP hosts which send data packets to randomly
chosen hosts or multicast groups.

Connections between router and hosts are configured as10Mb ethernet,
connections between the router are fast fibre optic cables. Host 2 is
connected to host 3 with a serial modem connection which is used only
for direct communication between them both - all other packets are
directly forwarded to router 1.
