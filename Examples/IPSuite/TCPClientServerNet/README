This example shows the use of TCP client/server models in an IP based
network.

The TCP Client/Server net consists of four hosts and one router. The
hosts named Client1-3 act as TCP clients and host Server4 as a TCP
server. The latter accepts TCP connections and tansmits data to the
clients.

The hosts are connected to a router each. Additionally, Client1 has a
direct connection to Server1.
