	* merged changes from MPLS/RSVP-TE model from UT Sydney

	* merged patches for compiling with MSVC.

        * module descriptions (comments) added to/rearranged in all NED files 
        for documentation generation with new opp_neddoc.

	* directory structure rearranged to correspond to IPv6Suite (and also
	OSI layers). Hopefully everything is now where one would expect.

	* added makemake.cmd for generating Makefile.vc's (using opp_nmakemake)
	for building with MSVC

	* lots of minor fixes to make the code compile with MSVC. 
	Note:
	  1. RETURN TYPE OF dup() should ALWAYS BE cObject* !
	  2. It is FORBIDDEN to initialize class variables (even const or
	     static const ones) within the class declaration !!! That violates 
	     the C++ standard, and not many compilers eat it except gcc!

	* updated for recent OMNeT++ versions: added ",row" to vector module
	display strings; removed className() methods, etc.

	* FIXME: KIDSRouter was missing from the original IPSuite! KIDSNw1 
	didn't compile. Temporarily fixed (copied NextHopRouter.)
